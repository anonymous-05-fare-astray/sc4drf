Semi-barriers (sync by one way signal):
sync1_norace.c: 2 thread sync using one lock, ok
sync1_race.c: like above but wrong: t1 can set then unset, then t0 sets, both write.
critsec3.c  : signal with busy wait loop using critical sections (*)
critsec3_race : has race due to different critical section names (*)
atomic3.c   :  sync with busy wait loop using atomic
atomic3_race.c : races because the write is not protected by atomic

Barriers:
bar1_norace.c: 2-thread flag barrier using busy-wait loops and critical, no race
bar1_race.c: wrong 2-thread flag barrier using busy-waits, race
bar2_norace.c: uses locks to create a barrier that is used once
bar2_race.c: like bar2_norace, but each thread uses its own lock, which doesn't work
bar3_norace.c: implements 2-thread reuseable barrier using 3 locks, no race
bar3_race.c: racy version of above, one synchronization commented out

Diffusions:
diffusion1_norace.c: for loop: new values go into separately malloc objects, swapped
diffusion1_race.c: same as above, but swap is wrong so u1=u2 and race
diffusion2_norace.c: like diffusion1, but two parts of one malloced object used
diffusion2_race.c: like above, but mistake in starting point of second half

Producer-consumer:
critsec2.c: : single producer single consumer with critical sections
critsec2_race : has race due to different critical section names
prodcons.c  : multiple producer, multiple consumer with critical sections
prodcons_race.c : races due to critical sections have different names
